## Minotauros

Solving an ASCII maze given as a command-line argument.
A python script runs through a Breadth-First Search on the given maze and presents how many moves it took.
The Rust program is supposed to do the same–with added functionality to change algorithms etc.–as a standalone application, but has severe bugs.

#### Usage on UNIX (bash)

Python:</br>
`chmod 777 scripts/minotauros.py` `./path/to/minotauros.py path/to/your/maze`

Rust: </br>
`cargo run path/to/your/file`
